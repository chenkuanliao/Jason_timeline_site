                <h2>Introduction For This Project</h2>
                <p>
                    I will use the significant information security incidents in Taiwan in the past two years to create a timeline and introduce Taiwan's recently established Information Security Agency of the Ministry of Digital Development under the Executive Yuan,
                    which mechanism is used to protect the information security of government agencies.
                </p>
                
                <h2>About the Administration for Cyber Security (MOCA)</h2>
                <p>The History of Administration:
                    The Executive Yuan established the Information Communication Security Office on March 8, 2012, and the Information Communication Security Office was formally established on August 1, 2015. On June 6, 2017, the Information Communication Security Management Law was announced to unify the national information communication security mechanism. The country's overall information security work is officially legalized.
                    On January 19, 2011, the Presidential Decree announced the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Digital Development. The Ministry of Digital Development is responsible for planning, reviewing, and supervising national information security policies, implementing national information security protection, drills and auditing operations, and communication and dissemination foundations. Facility protection, ad hoc information security department
                    
                    Organizational planning:
                    There are five groups and four offices under the agency, which are comprehensive planning, notification of emergency response, counseling and training, audit and inspection, regulations and national cooperation group, handling national information security policy planning, plan review, supervision and assessment, implementation of national Information security protection, drill and audit business, and communication infrastructure protection.
                    
                    The Act applies to:
                    In Taiwan, we have an information security protection law for information security protection, which classifies the information security levels of various agencies in our country and adopts different inspection standards, which are listed in the law. The requirements for communication protection are divided into three levels: high, medium, and low, respectively, in terms of confidentiality, integrity, usability, and compliance with laws and regulations. The impact of the disclosure of the information on the organization's operation is used as the judgment standard, and there are rules for information security details. There are complete and complete regulations, and there are blank clauses to take measures to make up for emergencies. The wording of this law refers to the National Institute of Standards and Technology) SP800-60 Volume I: Guild for Mapping Type of Information and Information System to Security Categories and the National Standard CNS 27001 "Information Technology - Security Technology - "Information Security Management - Requirements" and other documents stipulate the definitions of information communication system, information communication service, information communication security and information communication security incident in paragraphs 1 to 4. For infrastructure, refer to the critical infrastructure specified in 31 CFR 800.208 in the United States, the important social infrastructure operators specified in Article 3 of the Basic Law of Cyber Security in Japan (サイバーセキュリティ Basic Law), and the Korean Information and Communications Basic Protection Law (정보통신기반보호법) Second The definition of information and communication infrastructure in Article 7 clarifies the connotation of critical infrastructure, and considers that the scope of critical infrastructure may be adjusted in response to changes in the environment and the times. In addition, it also summarizes the content of the notification and the contingency measures that should be taken in case of information security incidents.
                    
                    Gain knowledge:
                    From various perspectives, information security is not only related to national security but also very important to private companies and various organizations. Modern people rely on a large amount of digital information to live. How to protect personal rights in the online world, legislation, administration, and private individuals are all responsible for Maintenance and protection. In recent years, conflicts between Taiwan and the other side have intensified. The Chinese government has also established an Information Security Agency and an Information and Electronic Army in response to the situation to meet the test of future information warfare. Taiwan's private enterprises should also upgrade their information security standards to prevent the public from the rights and interests of daily life and personal information is affected. It is also possible to classify information security incidents and carry out hierarchical and hierarchical processing.</p>

                                <p>Chunghwa Telecom's data breach occurred in March 2021, involving the personal data of approximately 3.1 million Chunghwa Telecom customers. According to the investigation, the incident was caused by data leakage due to the failure of the contractor hired by Chunghwa Telecom to keep the data correctly.
                                    The leaked information included sensitive personal information such as customer names, phone numbers, addresses, birthdays, and ID numbers. Chunghwa Telecom quickly took measures after the incident, stopped the cooperating contractors and notified the relevant government agencies, and activated the relevant response mechanism to provide free inquiry and monitoring services for the leaked data to protect the rights and interests of customers.
                                    This incident caused heavy losses to Chunghwa Telecom and its customers. Also, it aroused social concern about information security, reminding companies and individuals of the importance of protecting their information security.

                                <p>The Mackay Hospital ransomware attack occurred in May 2021. It was a ransomware attack. Attackers used malware to enter the hospital's information system, encrypt the information, and demand payment in Bitcoin. At that time, the patient information system of Mackay Hospital was attacked, and the patient information could not be queried. The doctor's order and medical records could not be added, which affected the patient's medical treatment and care arrangements. The hospital immediately activated the response mechanism, suspended the information system and network connection, and reported the incident to the government unit. Mackay Hospital announced that it would not pay the ransom but would use backup data to restore the system, update and strengthen protection measures for all affected systems, and strengthen information security monitoring and training. According to reports, the attack may have been launched by foreign hackers and has affected medical institutions around the world</p>

                                <p>The U.S. Navy facility attack occurred in July 2021. A Taiwanese cyber security company discovered that it was an information security attack launched by external hackers, targeting classified U.S. Navy facilities.

The attack lasted several weeks, and the Navy discovered the attack in mid-July. According to reports, the attackers used a unique hacking tool called "GoldMax," developed by a foreign hacker group identified by the U.S. government. Transnational information security incidents have shown the extent of global information security risks. Commonality and globalization, information security incidents between countries and regions often affect and implicate each other. Therefore, strengthening international information security cooperation and information sharing and jointly responding to information security threats and challenges is of great significance to safeguarding global information security and stability.</p>

                                <p>From 9:00 am to 10:30 am on June 28, 2022, many securities dealers' trading systems were disconnected, preventing investors from connecting to the trading systems to place orders. The automatic protection mechanism adopted in the case of abnormality, the occurrence of network abnormality is caused by the number of BGP routes exceeding the upper limit. This measure is to avoid network attacks, but it also affects the rights and interests of many network users. In the future, Chunghwa Telecom will cooperate with Other operators to coordinate reasonable network protection mechanism judgments and increase mechanisms such as horizontal contact and re-confirmation to avoid damage to the rights and interests of the public.s</p>
